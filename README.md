# Netherknight

A dungeon crawler based on Everknight, with more mechanics, better sprites, and maybe even more!

This means you can get the font from the repository's asset folder,
but in its usage you must give credit to its author and share it alike.

The disclaimer is vague because I am still testing the font,
and I might change it to another still. If so,
it will only be available in the repository's
history, but not in the actual game.
